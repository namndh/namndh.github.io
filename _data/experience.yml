    Worked as a Machine Learning engineer, I provided scalable, reuseable computer vision applications:
      - Money classification - Japan Cash Machine Co., Ltd.:
        - The objective of the project is to detect realtime real-counterfeit banknotes in cash machines
        - Analyzing and comparing classification algorithms and feature extractors using RGB and IR cameras
        - Providing APIs for GUI application
        - I used C++/OpenCV and Visual Studio 2015 in this project
      - Density Analysis:
        - The objective of project is detect and visualize density of people in static scenes in supermarkets, stations ...etc, for better advertising
        - I proposed two approaches to solve this problems:
          - Person detection pretrained YOLOv3 on MOT17DET dataset. This approach provides an online, realtime solution with better accuracy
          - Pre-trained CSRNET to understand crowded scenes. This approach requires knowledge about the scenes before executing, if not it would perform poorly
          - I used Pytorch and OpenCV-Python in this project

    I contributed to the company with these projects by using PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn:
      - Transaction classification for MoneyLover:
        - The objective is to classify transaction based on their description provided by banks
        - I implemented a CNN and customized Word2Vec model to do classification task. I also provide APIs for Money Lover web and application
      - User segmentation for crawling optimization:
        - The objective is to optimize the cost of crawling data by segmenting users in the system.
        - I used KNN model with statistic features
