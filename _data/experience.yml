    Worked as a Machine Learning engineer, I provided scalable, reuseable computer vision applications:
      - Money classification:
        - I delivered this project for JCM company in order to detect realtime real-counterfeit different banknotes in cash machine
        - Analysis and compare classification algorithms and feature extractors using RGB and IR cameras
        - Providing APIs for GUI application
        - I used C++/OpenCV and Visual Studio 2015 in this project
      - Density Analysis:
        - The objective of project is detect and visualize density of people in static scenes in supermarkets, stations for better advertising
        - I proposed to approaches to solve this problems:
          - YOLOv3 trained to detect person on MOT17DET dataset. This approach provides a online, real-time solution with better accuracy
          - Pre-trained CSRNET to understand crowed scenes. This approach requires knowledge about the scenes before running, if not it would perform poorly

    During the time working here, I contributed to the company with these projects:
      - Transaction classification for MoneyLover application:
        - The objective is to classify transaction based on their description provided by banks
        - In this project, I implemented a CNN and customized Word2Vec model to do classification task. I also provide APIs for web/app
      - User segmentation for crawling optimization:
        - The objective is to segment users into groups depend on their activities to schedule servers to crawl data to save the cost
        - I used statistic features and KNN to segments users in the system
    in these two projects, I used Pytorch, Pandas and Sklearn
