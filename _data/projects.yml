    In this project, the objective is visualizing realtime the density of pedestrians in areas where the CCTVs covered. 
    I proposed two approaches to solve this problem. Fistly I using YOLOv3 model trained on MOT17-DET to detect person. Secondly, I used CSRNET to estimate crowed scenes. I found that the solution using YOLOv3 provide a realtime solution and can be applied with the scene and the pose of perdestrians without pre-training.
    I used Gaussian matrix to represent a person detection area in heatmap and weighted accumulate the matrix during the time of video to visualize the density of perdestrians.
