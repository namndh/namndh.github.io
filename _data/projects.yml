    The objective of project is visualizing realtime the density of pedestrians in areas where the CCTVs covered. 
    I proposed two approaches to solve this problem. Firstly, I used YOLOv3 model trained on MOT17-DET to detect person. Secondly, I used CSRNET to estimate crowed scenes. I found that the solution using YOLOv3 provide a realtime solution and can be applied with the scene and the pose of perdestrians without pre-training.
    After that, I used Gaussian matrix to represent a person detection area in the heatmap and weighted accumulate the matrix during the time of video to visualize the density of perdestrians.

    I used this project as my graduation research at HUST and have this project A scored by both supervisor, and the thesis committee.
    The objective of this project is tracking pedestrians while remaining their identifications during the time they appeared in the video space.
    I proposed two solutions based on DeepSORT architecture,first, I replaced RCNN person detector by YoloV3 pre-trained on ImageNet. Second, I alter the DeepSORT architecture by using perameter-free spartition attention network as appearance descriptior.

    We used clustering algorithm, K-means and mean-shift algorithms with input is statistical data from users' activities to segment them into groups. We set different schedules for our servers for each group of users to crawl the data, which would help us save the cost of using service from third party companies.

    HUST - A project let me get familiar with image processing in C++
  description:
    We used several image processing algorithms such as binary image, Hough transform, edge detections algorithms, connected components to detect abnormal angle of connecting parts of cable
    Our application can work real time with industrial camera in speed of 8 FPS.
