    The objective of project is visualizing realtime the density of pedestrians in areas where the CCTVs covered. 
    I proposed two approaches to solve this problem. Fistly, I used YOLOv3 model trained on MOT17-DET to detect person. Secondly, I used CSRNET to estimate crowed scenes. I found that the solution using YOLOv3 provide a realtime solution and can be applied with the scene and the pose of perdestrians without pre-training.
    After that, I used Gaussian matrix to represent a person detection area in the heatmap and weighted accumulate the matrix during the time of video to visualize the density of perdestrians.

    I used this project as my graduation research at HUST and have this project A scored by both supervisor, and the thesis committee.
    The objective of this project is tracking pedestrians while remainning their identifications during the time they appeared in the video space.
    I proposed two solutions based on DeepSORT architecture,first, I replaced RCNN person detector by YoloV3 pretrained on ImageNet. Second, I alter the DeepSORT architecture by using perameter-free spartition attention network as appearance descriptior.

    The image of banknotes are captured by multiple sensors including RGB, IR. I used RGB and IR images with combination of classic classification algorithms such as SVM,KNN and Logistic Regression with feature extraction algorithms to classify real-counterfeit banknotes
