    I used this project as my graduation research at HUST and have this project A scored by both supervisor, and the thesis committee. |
    The objective of this project is tracking pedestrians while remaining their identifications during the time they appeared in the video space.
    I proposed two solutions based on DeepSORT architecture. First, I replaced RCNN person detector by Yolo V3 pre-trained on ImageNet. Second, I alter the DeepSORT architecture by using parameter-free spatial attention network as appearance descriptor.

    HUST - A project let me get familiar with image processing in C++
  description:
    We used several image processing algorithms such as binary image, Hough transform, edge detections algorithms, connected components to detect abnormal angle of connecting parts of cables.
    Our application can work real time with industrial camera in speed of 8 FPS.
