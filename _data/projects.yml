    The objective of this project is tracking pedestrians while remaining their identifications during the time they appeared in the image sequences as long as possible.
    I proposed two solutions based on DeepSORT architecture:
      - Firstly, I replaced RCNN person detector by Yolo V3 pre-trained on ImageNet. 
      - Second, I altered the DeepSORT architecture by using parameter-free spatial attention network as appearance descriptor.
    



    Both proposals provide higher accuracy results comparing to original methods. But only YoloV3 proposal satisfied real-time constraint.

    HUST - A project let me get familiar with image processing in C++
  description:
    We used several image processing algorithms such as binary image, Hough transform, edge detections algorithms, connected components to detect abnormal angle of connecting parts of cables.
    Our application can work real time with industrial camera in speed of 8 FPS.
